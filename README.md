# **Customer Segmentation & Product Profitability Analysis**

## **Overview**
This repository contains an analysis aimed at identifying **profitable customer segments** and **top-selling products** for better-targeted marketing. The goal is to optimize resource allocation and drive higher sales by understanding customer behavior and product profitability.

## **Problem**
Targeting generic customer groups and promoting all products equally leads to inefficient marketing campaigns. The challenge is to **identify the most profitable segments** and **highlight top-selling products** to maximize return on investment.


## **Solution**
We analyzed customer data and transaction records using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** and segmentation techniques to:
- Identify **high-value customer segments**.
- Uncover the **most profitable products**.
- Provide actionable insights to improve marketing strategies and sales growth.


## **Key Insights**

1. **Top Profitable Products:**
   - **Dorito Corn Chip Supreme** and **Smiths Crinkle Chips** emerged as the most profitable products.
   - These should be highlighted in **marketing campaigns** and **sales strategies**.

2. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - **Older families** and **premium customers** are the most valuable segments.
   - Tailored **loyalty programs** and **premium offers** should be prioritized for these groups.

3. **Loyalty Behavior:**
   - Loyal customers tend to prefer **non-premium snacks** like **Kettle Tortilla Chips**.
   - Personalizing offers for loyal customers will strengthen their engagement and retention.

## **Strategic Recommendations**

- **Enhance Loyalty Programs:** Offer exclusive rewards for repeat customers to encourage continued purchases.
- **Expand Top Products:** Introduce variations of best-selling products and ensure their visibility in all marketing efforts.
- **Optimize Marketing:** Focus advertising on top-selling products and use customer testimonials to build brand trust.
